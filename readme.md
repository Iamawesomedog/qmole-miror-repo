This is a mirror repo of qmole.

Qmole lets you run linux apps with a graphical user interface. Meaning you can run linux apps like they're your apps.
It stopped working after ios 8 so tough luck non legacy ipad owners. I didn't make this fyi, that's why it's a mirror. 

The original project is here: 
https://github.com/chriskmanx/qmole 

The source for the repo of the original project is here:
https://github.com/chriskmanx/qmole-packages

The original repo was this:
http://qmole.uk/linux/

But it clearly doesn't work anymore. You might be from 2069 and yell "no, it does work!" so I'll say that at the time of writing this it doesn't.

If you want to make your own mirror of qmole, it's very simple. You can just copy everything in the repo folder of the original qmole packages and host it somewhere.

If you want to change the repo's name, description, etc, just change the releases folder.

If you don't want all the links and everything there is to be broken,then uzip the packages folder, replace the links, and for the depictions, change the urls of the depictions to the new ones in your repo.

Me i don't care, as I'm only using this to download the stuff. If you want to read the dependencies or whatever else and manually download the debs, I've posted the txt file for packages in this.

All the debs themselves are in the pages branch because thats how codeberg turns them into a page.
